# Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition in Big Data and Machine Learning
The Code in this repository is used in the paper "Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition in Big Data and Machine Learning". It contains MATLAB files that execute examples and produce graphs that show the apllications of the research paper.

## Compressed_Neural_Network
This ipynb file creates a neural network that classifies randomly generated data into two classes, then compresses the final weights using SVD to create a compressed neural network. The accuracies of both networks are compared to test how well the compressed network can replicate the original classifications.

## Compressed_Neural_Network_mnist
This ipynb file creates a neural network that classifies the mnist data set (numbers 0-9), then compresses the final weights using SVD to create a compressed neural network. The accuracies of both networks are compared to test how well the compressed newtork can replicate the original classifications.
