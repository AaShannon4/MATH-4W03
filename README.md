# Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition in Big Data and Machine Learning
The Code in this repository is used in the paper "Compressed Sensing and Singular Value Decomposition in Big Data and Machine Learning". It contains MATLAB files that execute examples and produce graphs that show the apllications of the research paper.

## Compressed_Neural_Network
This ipynb file creates a neural network that classifies randomly generated data into two classes, then compresses the final weights using SVD to create a compressed neural network. The accuracies of both networks are compared to test how well the compressed network can replicate the original classifications.

## Compressed_Neural_Network_mnist
This ipynb file creates a neural network that classifies the mnist data set (numbers 0-9), then compresses the final weights using SVD to create a compressed neural network. The accuracies of both networks are compared to test how well the compressed newtork can replicate the original classifications.

## Compressed_Sensing_Fourier
This MATLAB file creates a sparse signal in a Fourier basis, and applies the compressed sensing algorithm to reconstruct the signal in the spike basis.

## Compressed_Sensing_Image
This MATLAB file takes a smaller section of the full grey-scale cameraman image and applies both the least squares approximation and the compressed sensing algorithm to reconstruct the image with a smaller number of measurements.

## Compressed_Sensing_Random
This MATLAB file produces a random colour image and applies both the least squares approximation and the compressed sensing algorithm to reconstruct the random image with a smaller number of measurements.

## Data Compressions Graph
This MATLAB file produces a graph of the data compression of a Best Rank k approximation for the Singular Value Decomposition Algorithm.

## KSVD
This ipynb file simulates the K-SVD algorithm on an over complete dictionary.
